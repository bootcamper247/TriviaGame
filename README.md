# The Trivia Game
## https://bootcamper247.github.io/TriviaGame/
## HTML/CSS/JQuery

- Here's how the app works:

- When the user presses start, the trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

- If the player selects the correct answer, a screen shows congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question shows up without user input.

- If the player runs out of time, tells the player that time's up and displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.

- If the player chooses the wrong answer, tells the player they selected the wrong option and then displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.

- On the final screen, shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
